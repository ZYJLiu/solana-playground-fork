# Attack Instruction

The `attack` instruction is used to simulate an attack on the `enemy_boss` in the game. It first checks if the boss has enough health to be attacked; if the health is 0, an error is returned.

The damage dealt to the boss is generated pseudo-randomly using an XORShift algorithm with the current slot as an input seed.

```rust
pub fn xorshift64(seed: u64) -> u64 {
    let mut x = seed;
    x ^= x << 13;
    x ^= x >> 7;
    x ^= x << 17;
    x
}
```

The `attack` instruction requires the following accounts:

- `player` - The account of the player that signs the transaction and initiates the attack.
- `enemy_boss` - The `enemy_boss` account whose health will be reduced by the attack.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Attack<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"boss"],
        bump,
    )]
    pub enemy_boss: Account<'info, EnemyBoss>,
}
```

The `attack` instruction generates a random damage value and subtracts it from the `enemy_boss` health.

```rust
pub fn attack(ctx: Context<Attack>) -> Result<()> {
    // Check if enemy boss has enough health
    if ctx.accounts.enemy_boss.health == 0 {
        return err!(ErrorCode::NotEnoughHealth);
    }

    // Get current slot
    let slot = Clock::get()?.slot;

    // Generate pseudo-random number using XORShift with the current slot as seed
    let xorshift_output = xorshift64(slot);

    // Calculate random damage
    let random_damage = xorshift_output % (MAX_DAMAGE);
    msg!("Random Damage: {}", random_damage);

    // Subtract health from enemy boss, min health is 0
    ctx.accounts.enemy_boss.health =
        ctx.accounts.enemy_boss.health.saturating_sub(random_damage);
    msg!("Enemy Boss Health: {}", ctx.accounts.enemy_boss.health);

    Ok(())
}
```
