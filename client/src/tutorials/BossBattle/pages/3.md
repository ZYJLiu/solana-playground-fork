# Respawn Instruction

The `respawn` instruction is used to reset the health of the `enemy_boss` account to the maximum health, essentially "respawning" the boss for another round of battle in the game. This instruction is required when the boss's health has been reduced to 0, and a player wants to attack the boss again.

The `respawn` instruction requires the following accounts:

- `player` - The account of the player that signs the transaction.
- `enemy_boss` - The enemy_boss account whose health is to be reset. This account is created if it doesn't exist already.
- `system_program` - A required account when creating a new account.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Respawn<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        init_if_needed,
        payer = player,
        space = 8 + 8,
        seeds = [b"boss"],
        bump,
    )]
    pub enemy_boss: Account<'info, EnemyBoss>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

The `respawn` instruction resets the health of the `enemy_boss` account to `MAX_HEALTH`.

```rust
pub fn respawn(ctx: Context<Respawn>) -> Result<()> {
    // Reset enemy boss to max health
    ctx.accounts.enemy_boss.health = MAX_HEALTH;
    Ok(())
}
```
